# Embedded common utilities

Independent header-only C99/C++11 component, bundled with KymoCore so the
package stays self-contained. No Kymo types, Arduino/HAL headers, heap or
global mutable state. Include individual headers or copy this directory into
another ECU project.

- `embedded_bits.h`: constant-expression `EMB_U8_OR`, typed mask predicates,
  checked byte-bit selection and capacity-checked bitset access.
- `embedded_bytes.h`: unaligned little-endian uint32/binary32 reads and writes,
  using memcpy for float bit conversion rather than pointer aliasing.
- `embedded_crc.h`: MSB-first CRC8 with configurable polynomial and initial
  value; the protocol layer selects CRC-8/ATM parameters.

Constant masks use a macro because static C initializers require constant
expressions. It evaluates each argument once; operands must not have mutually
dependent side effects because C does not order their evaluation. Runtime
operations use typed `static inline` functions, allowing compiler optimization
without macro repetition. Inlining and runtime speed are compiler decisions;
this design does not assume that macros are inherently faster.

Bit indices outside 0–7 yield zero. Bitset helpers check byte capacity and null
pointers before access. Raw byte-conversion helpers require a valid four-byte
region; the caller validates it once. Float conversion requires IEEE-754
binary32. CRC treats null data as an empty input and returns the initial value.
Every non-void function has exactly one final return; void helpers have none.

Tests: `test/native/common_test.c`, compiled through `tools/test_native.py`.
